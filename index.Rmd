# What do we mean by API?

<aside class="notes">
* What do we mean by API?
* Quick example using an API from R
* How does the web work?
* Show postman
* The httr package
* Writing R functions to access an API
</aside>

## In this context

> An API is something I use to retrieve and (maybe) update data.

![data api](images/data_api.png)

<aside class="notes">

* Lots of things from graphics to the file system. ODBC is an API.
* Data heads mean CRUD, or even just reading

An  API can be lots of things, from a graphics engine, to DLLs, to the OS-dependent things like the file system.

When data heads are talking about an API, they often mean an abstract interface which gives them the ability to extract data from a remote source. That's generic enough that ODBC qualifies as an API.
</aside>

## The important point:

> The implementation details about how data is accessed and returned to the user are not important to the consumer of the API.   

It just works.

<aside class="notes">
So, we don't really care 
</aside>

## Example

```{r }
library(udapi)
dfUD <- udapi::get_term("depp")
dfUD$definition[1:2]
```

## Basically the same as this

## Web APIs

<aside class="notes">
So, there's a wide array of data on the web and many different ways to access it. What's the common denominator?
</aside>

> "Right now, the closest thing we have to a generic API client is a library that sends HTTP requests. This was true in 2007, and itâ€™s still true."

# How does HTTP work?

## Your grandfather explains the internet

![http](images/http.png)

## Implications

* Transactional and discrete. A computer sends a __request__ to another computer, which sends back a __response__. End.
* Stateless, like talking to a really drunk person. You have to keep reintroducing yourselves.
* May be asynchronous.
* Probably overheard. Use encryption.
* In principle, client  and server are not special. In practice, we're usually clients. We send requests and get back responses.
* Request and response may be broader than information retrieval. May also involve _transformation_ of data like language translation, or model construction (e.g. statistical transformations).

<aside class="notes">
A computer - which we'll call a client - sends a request to another computer that we'll call a server. The names are somewhat arbitrary. The roles of client and server could be reversed.
</aside>

## The request 

<span class="left">
  ![request structure](images/request2.png)
</span>

<span class="right">
<ul>
<li>URL - obvious</li>
<li>Method - GET, PUT, etc. More on that in a moment.</li>
<li>Header - Tells the remote computer about how to handle the request. Includes timestamp, source of the request, user and session info. May include authentication data.</li>
<li>Body - If we're _adding_ or _updating_ data, there's information here.</li>
</ul>
</span>

## Methods

| Method  | Function                    |
|:--------|:----------------------------|
| GET     | Retrieves a resource        |
| POST    | Create a new resource       |
| PUT     | Update an existing resource |
| PATCH   | Similar to PUT, but may update only certain components of a resource |
| DELETE  | Remove a resource           |
| HEAD    | Identical to GET, but does not return body |
| OPTIONS | Request information about the server |

And there are others.

<aside class="notes">
The methods are verbs which encompass the full set of CRUD operations. Permissions will be specific to a server.
</aside>

## The response 

<span class="left">
  ![response structure](images/response_structure.png)
</span>

<span class="right">
<ul>
<li>Status code - This is important.</li>
<li>Header - Tells the requesting computer about how to handle the response. This will include things like format of the data.</li>
<li>Body - This is the good stuff. For data requests, we're probably returning XML, JSON or CSV.</li>
</ul>
</span>

## Response status codes

| Number  | Meaning                    |
|:--------|:----------------------------|
| 1xx  | Informational           |
| 2xx     | Success        |
| 3xx    | Redirection       |
| 4xx     | Client error |
| 5xx    | Server error |

## This may all be done from a terminal

```
curl "https://www.goodreads.com/search.xml?key=MY_KEY&q=Richard+Feynman"
```

## Or in a browser

![browser response](images/browser_response.png)

## Postman

## Postman example

![postman example](images/postman_example.png)

## Fundamental takeaways

* A web API lets us read data without needing to know how the data is obtained.
* Request and response objects tell _both_ computers everything they need to know about how the conversation is going.
* There is nothing magical about how to access a web API. If you can connect to the interwebs, you're good to go. _A browser is a tool that makes HTTP response objects look pretty!_

# Some actual APIs

## 

## Where to find APIs

* [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis) has a list of over 17,000 APIs!
* [Python for beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/api/list-of-python-apis) - Not a big list, but all have Python wrappers
* [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/)
* [Reverse dependencies for httr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr)

# The httr package

## The httr package

* Strongly influenced by the python package [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/).
* Exposes GET, PUT, PUSH, etc as R functions

## Let's access some data!

```{r}
library(httr)

base_url <- 'http://nflarrest.com/api/v1/'
crimes_url <- paste0(base_url, 'crime')
response <- GET(crimes_url)
```

## The response object

```{r}
response
response$status_code
response$headers$`content-type`
```

## What did our request look like?

Weirdly, we need to get a response to see this.

```{r}
req <- response$request
req
```

## Adding elements to the request header

This must take place within the HTTP verb function call

```{r}
response <- GET(crimes_url
                , user_agent("PirateGrunt/0.1 (FanninQED@Yahoo.com)"))
```

## Common header fields

* authenticate() - Named parameters for user, password and auth type. Default type is basic
* user_agent() - `httr` will default to some form of "httr"
* use_proxy()
* set_cookies()


## content

```{r}
the_content <- content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
typeof(the_content)
the_content
response$headers$`content-type`
```

## How do __YOU__ pronounce JSON?

"JSON" of Star Command?

![JSON of Star Command](images/jason_star_command.jpg)

## Convert to a data frame

```{r }
library(jsonlite)
dfCrime <- fromJSON(the_content, simplifyDataFrame =  TRUE)
head(dfCrime)
```

## Change the request

Let's only bring back the top 2 crimes. We can use the `modify_url` function from `httr`.

```{r}
top2_url <- modify_url(crimes_url, query = list(limit = 2))
top2_url

response <- GET(top2_url)

# Can also do this in one shot
response <- GET(crimes_url, query = list(limit = 2))

the_content <- content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
dfCrime <- fromJSON(the_content, simplifyDataFrame =  TRUE)
head(dfCrime)
```

## Use the results to make new requests

List players who have been arrested for DUI

```{r}
top_crime <- dfCrime$Category[1]
player_crime_url <- paste0(base_url, "crime/topPlayers/", top_crime)
response <- GET(player_crime_url)
the_content <- content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
dfPlayerDUI <- fromJSON(the_content, simplifyDataFrame =  TRUE)
head(dfPlayerDUI)
```

## Writing your own functions 

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

GetTeamPlayer <- function(team){
  team_player_url <- "http://nflarrest.com/api/v1/team/topPlayers/"
  team_player_url <- paste0(team_player_url, team)
  response <- GET(team_player_url)
  the_content <- content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
  df <- fromJSON(the_content, simplifyDataFrame =  TRUE)
  df
}
```

## Your own functions (2)

```{r }
dfPlayers <- GetTeamPlayer(team = "CIN")
head(dfPlayers)
```

## Create a package

Wrapping API calls with a function is an easy on-ramp to creating a package.

## Crimes by position

```{r}
load("./all_arrests.rda")
dfCrimesByPosition <- dfAllArrests %>% 
  group_by(Position_name) %>% 
  summarise(num_arrests = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_arrests))
```

## Crimes by position

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
reorder_size <- function(df) {
  df <- arrange(df, desc(num_arrests))
  factor(df$Position_name, levels = df$Position_name)
}
plt <- ggplot(dfCrimesByPosition, aes(reorder_size(dfCrimesByPosition), num_arrests)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
plt <- plt + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20))
plt + ggplot2::xlab("Position") + ylab("Average arrests")
```

## httr is _not_ the only game in town

rOpenSci also has some packages to work with HTTP.

https://ropensci.org/packages/#http_tools

## And now let's see that in Python

## APIs may _transform_ data

Use an API to build a library of functions.

## Public API caveats

* Terms of use
* Non-commercial
* Access limits
* Authentication

## So go build some APIs!

* Seems to be more Python than R, we could even that out
* Great way to get started writing packages
* Build your portfolio
* Help out others!
* Excellent source of fun data to practice techniques

# Thanks for listening!
